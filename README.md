<h1 align="center">HentaiKilla | Hentai Hell Cheat</h1>

  ## üñ•Ô∏è What is this?
- ‚ö° So I made this to get some more knowledge on making cheats with unity games. I feel like I have gained a decent amount of starting knowledge. I really enjoyed making this and I hope you guys who are learning can gain some knowledge about making Mono cheats.

  ## üñ•Ô∏è How can I use this?
- ‚ö° You can go to monocheat > bin > debug > and then get the MonoCheat.dll DLL. This is what you want to inject into the game with a MonoInjector. I recomend using SharpMonoInjector. When using SharpMonoInjector for the class name enter HentaiKilla and then for method name use Load.

  ## üñ•Ô∏è Features
- ‚ö° Godmode
- ‚ö° Unlimited ammo
- ‚ö° Bhop
- ‚ö° Speed changer
